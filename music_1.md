**Prompt: “Timeless Winter Lullaby”**

1. Style & Mood  
   • Soft, gentle, reverent, serene, heart-warming  
   • Evoke the same sense of wonder, peace, and quiet grace found in classic carols like “Silent Night” and “O Holy Night”  
   • Intended for all ages and cultures; universal appeal, comforting and nostalgic yet fresh

2. Tempo & Meter  
   • 60-72 BPM (adagio)  
   • 6/8 or 3/4 time signature for a lilting, cradle-like sway

3. Harmony & Tonality  
   • Major key (e.g., G-major, F-major, or C-major) with occasional vi–IV–I–V or IV-I-ii°-V cadences  
   • Touches of modal mixture or a brief minor subdominant to add emotional depth  
   • Warm, consonant extended harmonies (add-2, add-9, gentle 6ths) without dense jazz tensions

4. Melody  
   • Memorable, singable, stepwise contours with occasional leaps of a 3rd, 4th, or 5th for lift  
   • Phrase structure: two 8-bar antecedent + consequent phrases, then a 16-bar contrasting B-section that lifts an octave, resolving back to the A-theme

5. Instrumentation  
   • Core: soft piano or warm felted piano, delicate finger-style acoustic guitar, subtle choir “ah” or “ooh” pads  
   • Optional: light strings (legato violins, violas, pizzicato cellos), solo flute or clarinet for countermelody, glockenspiel or celesta for sparkling highlights  
   • Very sparse percussion—if any, a barely-there brushed snare or soft hand-held chimes on downbeats

6. Texture & Dynamics  
   • Begin nearly solo (piano or guitar), pp dynamic  
   • Gradual swell to mp-mf by the B-section with strings/choir entering  
   • Return to intimate texture for final reprise, ending in a whispered cadence

7. Structure / Form (approx. 3:30)  
   A (0:00-0:45) – Intro & first theme, solo piano/guitar  
   A’ (0:45-1:30) – Add soft choir pad, subtle strings  
   B (1:30-2:15) – Lift to higher register, introduce flute countermelody, dynamic swell  
   A’’ (2:15-3:00) – Return to main theme, gentle bells accent  
   Outro (3:00-3:30) – Fade out on sustained tonic chord with natural reverb

8. Production Notes  
   • Spacious, airy reverb reminiscent of a candle-lit cathedral or peaceful winter landscape  
   • Mastering target: ‑14 LUFS for streaming; keep peaks below ‑1 dBFS to preserve headroom  
   • Aim for subtle stereo width; avoid heavy compression to maintain organic dynamics

9. Emotional Goal  
   • Listeners should feel calm, reflective, and comforted—perfect for winter evenings, holiday gatherings, relaxation, or bedtime listening  
   • Must sound both classic and contemporary; no dated synths or overtly modern EDM elements

10. Descriptive Tags for the AI (optional)
