The user wants me to create a prompt for an AI music generator that will inspire it to create beautiful, soft music similar to classics like "Silent Night" and "O Holy Night". These are timeless pieces that appeal across all ages and cultures. Let me analyze what makes these songs so universally beloved:

Key characteristics:  
- Gentle, flowing melodies  
- Simple yet emotionally powerful progressions  
- Often in 3/4 or 6/8 time (waltz-like)  
- Peaceful, contemplative mood  
- Traditional instrumentation  
- Clear, memorable melodic lines  
- Natural dynamic swells  
- Sacred but accessible feeling  

I need to craft a comprehensive prompt that captures these qualities while encouraging originality. The prompt should be detailed enough to guide the AI but not so restrictive that it stifles creativity.  

Here's a carefully crafted prompt for an AI music generator to create timeless, beautiful soft music:

**AI Music Generation Prompt:**

"Compose a gentle, emotionally resonant instrumental piece with the following characteristics:

**Mood & Atmosphere:**
- Create a deeply peaceful, contemplative atmosphere that evokes feelings of serenity, wonder, and quiet joy
- Channel the timeless quality of traditional lullabies and sacred music
- Build an emotional arc that feels both intimate and universally touching

**Musical Structure:**
- Time signature: 3/4 or 6/8 for a gentle, flowing waltz-like feel
- Tempo: Andante (76-84 BPM) - unhurried and graceful
- Key: Major key (C, F, or G major work beautifully) with occasional minor chord colors for emotional depth
- Form: Simple ABA or verse-chorus structure with a memorable, singable main melody

**Melodic Guidelines:**
- Craft a simple, stepwise melody that moves primarily by small intervals
- Include gentle ascending and descending phrases that feel like natural breathing
- Leave space between phrases - embrace the power of silence
- Create a melody so clear and memorable it could be hummed by anyone

**Harmonic Palette:**
- Use warm, traditional chord progressions (I-IV-V-I, I-vi-IV-V)
- Include gentle suspensions that resolve sweetly
- Add occasional secondary dominants for color without complexity
- Keep harmonies rich but transparent

**Instrumentation:**
- Primary: Soft piano or acoustic guitar
- Supporting: Warm string ensemble (violins, violas, cellos)
- Optional subtle additions: Gentle harp glissandos, soft woodwinds (flute, oboe), or ethereal choir pads
- Avoid percussion except perhaps the gentlest of bells or chimes

**Dynamic Expression:**
- Begin softly (pp-p) and maintain overall gentle dynamics
- Include natural swells that rise and fall like gentle waves
- Build to a warm, full (but never harsh) climax about 2/3 through
- Return to quietness for a peaceful conclusion

**Production Notes:**
- Use generous reverb to create a sense of sacred space
- Keep the mix transparent - every element should breathe
- Emphasize warmth over brightness in the EQ
- Create a sound that feels both timeless and comforting

The final piece should feel like a musical embrace - something that could comfort a child, bring peace to the elderly, and touch hearts across all cultures. Think 'musical moonlight' - gentle, beautiful, and eternal."
